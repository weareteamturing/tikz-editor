# tikz-editor
A WYSIWYG editor foundation for TikZ with a layered parser -> semantic IR -> SVG pipeline.

## Architecture of parsing and rendering
1. Parser (`/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/packages/core/src/parser`) parses TikZ into a lossless AST with diagnostics.
2. Semantic evaluator (`/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/packages/core/src/semantic`) resolves styles, transforms, coordinates, and path semantics into a scene graph.
3. SVG backend (`/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/packages/core/src/svg`) emits pure SVG from scene elements.
4. Render convenience API (`/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/packages/core/src/render`) provides end-to-end source -> SVG orchestration.

More detail is in `/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/docs/architecture.md`.

## Apps

1. Web app (`/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/apps/web`)
2. Desktop app (`/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/apps/desktop`) built with Tauri

## Capability Matrix
Capabilities are tracked explicitly in:
1. `/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/packages/core/src/capabilities/feature-ids.ts`
2. `/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/packages/core/src/capabilities/matrix.ts`
3. `/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/packages/core/src/capabilities/registries.ts`

Capability drift is CI-gated by `/Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/test/capabilities.spec.ts`.

## Scripts
1. `npm run typecheck` runs root TypeScript checks (`tsc --noEmit`).
2. `npm test` runs all vitest suites (`generate:grammar` + `vitest run`).
3. `npm run test:capabilities` runs capability matrix guards only.
4. `npm run test:corpus` runs PGF corpus regression only.
5. `npm run test:e2e` runs web Playwright suites.
6. `npm run test:e2e:ci` runs web Playwright suites with line reporter.
7. `npm run test:desktop:e2e` runs desktop e2e (may skip on unsupported platforms).
8. `npm run build` builds the core parser package.
9. `cd /Users/dominik/GitHub/tikz-editor/apps/web && npm run build` builds the web app.
10. `npm run compare:renderers -- --input path/to/snippet.tex` runs our renderer and a TeX reference render, then writes a comparison manifest.
14. `npm run compare:pgf-docs -- --source-file pgfmanual-en-tikz-paths.tex` renders snippets from one PGF doc source file and writes an `index.html` side-by-side gallery. It generates side-by-side.png files that can be visually inspected for render accuracy.

## Corpus Source
The repository includes `pgf-docs/`, a copy of the PGF manual source files. It also includes `pgf-src/`, a copy of the PGF source files. Both should be used to check the intended rendering of TikZ features against the reference implementation. The `pgf-docs/` snippets are also used for testing and capability tracking.

## Testing note
vitest doesn’t support --runInBand in this environment.

## Profiling Scripts
Performance profiling scripts live in `apps/web/profiling/`. They use Playwright + CDP to capture CPU profiles of the running web app. They are manual dev tools, not part of CI.

Run from `apps/web/`:
```
npx playwright test --config profiling/playwright.config.ts profiling/profile-paper-drag.spec.ts
npx playwright test --config profiling/playwright.config.ts profiling/profile-paper-selection.spec.ts
etc.
```

The config builds the app in production mode and serves it on port 4174. Set `TIKZ_PROFILE_VERBOSE=1` for verbose logging. Output `.cpuprofile` and `-report.json` files go to `apps/web/profiling/traces/`.

CPU profiles JSON reports can be inspected directly. To analyze a `.cpuprofile` programmatically:
```
node scripts/analyze-cpuprofile.mjs apps/web/profiling/traces/paper-drag-visible.cpuprofile
```

## Tauri

Tauri docs for the desktop app are available in `tauri-docs/` for local search.
